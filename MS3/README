1. Setup
2. Login Credentials
3. MySQL Database Updates
-------------------------------

1. SETUP:
-Unzip the file and place the entire MS3 folder in your AMPPS www folder.
-Run the SQL script Milestone4_DB.txt to create the database, tables, etc.
-The connection.php file should have login credentials, but if not, use
the login credentials below.
-Start on Login.php
-Assume every field is required except: 
	Personal Information:
		Middle Initial
		Preferred Name
		Unit Number
		Military Branch (this is auto populated, but the code sets to NULL
	    unless veteran status is checked)

		**Database script written with assumption user creates username +
		  password and then uses them to log in and create a new application.
	
2.LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
To be used with connection.php


3. CHANGELOG FOR DATABASE SCRIPT:
-Added user table to hold user/password credentials
-Divided main Application table into 3 tables, one for each page,
consisting of New_Application, Personal_Information, and Application_Information.
